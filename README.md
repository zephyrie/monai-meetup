# MONAI Meetup Website

This repo contains source code and content for a MONAI Meetup website.

## Local Development

To modify the website, you should run:

`npm run build`

so that the CSS is dynamically rebuilt as you modify any CSS.  You can also place any custom css in ./build/custom.css and it will also get built in to the main css file.
